<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")

### [3] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-08-19 14:43:47 UTC

````
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths, revealing whether longer reasoning chains cause more
  internal inconsistency.
approach: >-
  For each problem in the mini dataset: (1) Generate a CoT answer at three controlled lengths — short (few-shot with 'solve
  concisely'), medium (default CoT), long (few-shot with 'show all steps in detail'). Use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling.
  (2) For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT,
  producing a self-check answer. (3) Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, whether they agree, CoT accuracy vs ground truth,
  and CoT token count. (4) Plot agreement rate vs CoT length for each difficulty tier. Use a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., a capable but low-cost model like llama-3 or mistral). Start with preview (5 problems) to validate pipeline, then
  scale to mini (50 problems) using gradual scaling pattern. Track cumulative LLM cost and stop at $10.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths, revealing whether longer reasoning chains cause more

approach: >-
  For each problem in the mini dataset: (1) Generate a CoT answer at three controlled lengths — short (few-shot with 'solve
  concisely'), medium (default CoT), long (few-shot with 'show all steps in detail'). Use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling.
  (2) For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT,
  producing a self-check answer. (3) Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, whether they agree, CoT accuracy vs ground truth,
  and CoT token count. (4) Plot agreement rate vs CoT length for each difficulty tier. Use a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., a capable but low-cost model like llama-3 or mistral). Start with preview (5 problems) to validate pipeline, then
  scale to mini (50 problems) using gradual scaling pattern. Track cumulative LLM cost and stop at $10.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>

<skills>
Skills are self-contained capabilities with instructions, context, and tools.

- aii-web-tools: Free-first web search (general + scholarly modes), page/PDF fetch as markdown, regex grep over page/PDF text
- aii-semscholar-bib: Batch-fetch BibTeX from Semantic Scholar
- aii-openrouter-llms: Search and call 300+ LLMs via OpenRouter
- aii-hf-datasets: Search, preview, download HuggingFace datasets
- aii-owid-datasets: Search and load Our World in Data tables
- aii-lean: Compile/verify Lean 4 code, Mathlib search, tactic suggestions
- aii-concept-fig-gen: Generate/edit images via Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)
- aii-json: Validate JSON against schemas, generate mini/preview variants
- aii-paper-writing: Academic paper structure, bibliography, citations
- aii-paper-to-latex: Assemble LaTeX papers and compile to PDF
- aii-parallel-computing: GPU acceleration, CPU parallelism, async I/O
- aii-python: Python coding standards for experiment scripts
- aii-use-hardware: Detect CPU/RAM/GPU, memory-safe processing
- aii-long-running-tasks: Gradual scaling pattern for long-running tasks
- aii-colab: Google Colab runtime constraints for notebooks
- aii-file-size-limit: Check and split oversized output files
</skills>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.

  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)

<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>

<skills>
Skills are self-contained capabilities with instructions, context, and tools.

- aii-web-tools: Free-first web search (general + scholarly modes), page/PDF fetch as markdown, regex grep over page/PDF text
- aii-semscholar-bib: Batch-fetch BibTeX from Semantic Scholar
- aii-openrouter-llms: Search and call 300+ LLMs via OpenRouter
- aii-hf-datasets: Search, preview, download HuggingFace datasets
- aii-owid-datasets: Search and load Our World in Data tables
- aii-lean: Compile/verify Lean 4 code, Mathlib search, tactic suggestions
- aii-concept-fig-gen: Generate/edit images via Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)
- aii-json: Validate JSON against schemas, generate mini/preview variants
- aii-paper-writing: Academic paper structure, bibliography, citations
- aii-paper-to-latex: Assemble LaTeX papers and compile to PDF

- aii-long-running-tasks: Gradual scaling pattern for long-running tasks
- aii-colab: Google Colab runtime constraints for notebooks
- aii-file-size-limit: Check and split oversized output files
</skills>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends.

Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths, revealing whether longer reasoning chains cause more
  internal inconsistency.
approach: >-
  For each problem in the mini dataset: (1) Generate a CoT answer at three controlled lengths — short (few-shot with 'solve
  concisely'), medium (default CoT), long (few-shot with 'show all steps in detail'). Use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling.
  (2) For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT,
  producing a self-check answer. (3) Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, whether they agree, CoT accuracy vs ground truth,
  and CoT token count. (4) Plot agreement rate vs CoT length for each difficulty tier. Use a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., a capable but low-cost model like llama-3 or mistral). Start with preview (5 problems) to validate pipeline, then
  scale to mini (50 problems) using gradual scaling pattern. Track cumulative LLM cost and stop at $10.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.

Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths, revealing whether longer reasoning chains cause more
  internal inconsistency.
approach: >-
  For each problem in the mini dataset: (1) Generate a CoT answer at three controlled lengths — short (few-shot with 'solve
  concisely'), medium (default CoT), long (few-shot with 'show all steps in detail'). Use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling.
  (2) For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT,
  producing a self-check answer. (3) Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, whether they agree, CoT accuracy vs ground truth,
  and CoT token count. (4) Plot agreement rate vs CoT length for each difficulty tier. Use a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., a capable but low-cost model like llama-3 or mistral). Start with preview (5 problems) to validate pipeline, then
  scale to mini (50 problems) using gradual scaling pattern. Track cumulative LLM cost and stop at $10.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths, revealing whether longer reasoning chains cause more
  internal inconsistency.
approach: >-
  For each problem in the mini dataset: (1) Generate a CoT answer at three controlled lengths — short (few-shot with 'solve
  concisely'), medium (default CoT), long (few-shot with 'show all steps in detail'). Use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling.
  (2) For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT,
  producing a self-check answer. (3) Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, whether they agree, CoT accuracy vs ground truth,
  and CoT token count. (4) Plot agreement rate vs CoT length for each difficulty tier. Use a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., a capable but low-cost model like llama-3 or mistral). Start with preview (5 problems) to validate pipeline, then
  scale to mini (50 problems) using gradual scaling pattern. Track cumulative LLM cost and stop at $10.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

Can shorter chain-of-thought reduce contradiction in model self-checks?

### [35] THINKING · 2026-08-19 14:54:35 UTC

```
Let me start by understanding the task. I need to create a detailed plan for an experiment artifact that tests the hypothesis about "Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning." The plan needs to be concrete and actionable for an executor agent.

Let me first check what resources are available - the hypothesis, the artifact direction, and any user uploads that might be relevant. I should also look up relevant papers to make the plan more concrete.

Let me read the hypothesis and artifact direction carefully, then do some research to make the plan actionable.

The star is the SUBSTRATE below \u2014 a dated, source-anchored map of where the field stands mid-2026,\nwith an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions; nothing here prescribes a direction. Every\n[Sn] resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md); date-sensitive figures live in [volatile.md](volatile.md).\n\n## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)\n\n- The newest synthesis organizes the field as the LIFE progression \u2014 Lay the capability foundation \u2192 Integrate\n  through collaboration \u2192 Find faults through attribution \u2192 Evolve through self-improvement \u2014 with the F\u2192E\n  handoff as its named weak link [S2].\n- The failure locus is coordination, not member capability: errors propagate across agents and interaction\n  rounds, are hard to diagnose, and rarely feed back into structure [S2] [S1].\n- The field's working null hypothesis is economic: token spend, not architecture, explains most performance\n  variance, so any structural claim is judged against matched-compute aggregation [S3] [S7].\n- That null now has a theory: at a fixed reasoning-token budget with perfect context use, a single agent is more\n  information-efficient (Data Processing Inequality \u2014 each handoff can only lose information); MAS is predicted\n  competitive only where context use degrades or more compute is spent [S6].\n- Verification is treated as easier than generation, so verifier count is a live test-time scaling axis [S15] \u2014\n  but self-evaluation without an external signal is known to fail and can degrade answers [S16].\n- Inter-agent natural language is a chosen tradeoff, not a given: interpretable and overseeable, but argued\n  structurally misaligned with the vector spaces models compute in (information loss, behavioral drift) [S18].\n\n## Frontier (recency-weighted)\n\n### Structure vs matched compute (weight-capped here \u2014 the saturated core, see repeller)\n\n- First systematic multi-agent-debate evaluation (5 MAD methods \u00d7 9 benchmarks \u00d7 4 models): MAD often fails to\n  beat single-agent CoT / Self-Consistency even at much higher inference compute; the one robust lever found is\n  model heterogeneity, named a universal antidote [S7] (2025-02, rev 2025-06).\n- The critique now has a theory, not just benchmarks: the Data Processing Inequality argument predicts exactly\n  when MAS becomes competitive \u2014 degraded single-agent context use, or extra compute [S6] (2026-04).\n\n### Topology & orchestration\n\n- Adaptive/learned MAS optimized per-benchmark show \"topological overfitting\" (no cross-domain transfer) and\n  \"illusory coordination\" (surface accuracy while interactions diverge from intended behavior) [S9] (2026-04).\n- Live counter-current: task-adaptive topology routing (parallel / sequential / hierarchical / hybrid per task)\n  reports 12\u201323% over static single-topology baselines at identical models \u2014 single-author preprint, directly\n  clashing with [S9]; see Open questions [S10] (2026-02).\n\n### Failure, attribution & repair\n\n- MAST is the field's failure instrument \u2014 exact figures (commonly mis-recalled): taxonomy built from 150 traces\n  (kappa = 0.88), 14 modes / 3 categories; MAST-Data = 1600+ annotated traces, 7 frameworks [S1] (2025-03, rev 2025-10).\n- Failure attribution (which agent, which step) is formalized and benchmarked \u2014 and far from solved: the best\n  automated method reaches 53.5% (Who&When, ICML 2025 Spotlight) [S12] (2025-04).\n- Verifier/critic agents act with a DELAY, so false claims propagate before correction \u2014 yielding instability\n  thresholds and optimal corrector placement (single-author preprint) [S13] (2026-06).\n- E-stage methods arriving: TPGO treats the MAS as a graph of optimizable nodes and derives textual feedback\n  from execution traces to pinpoint failures and suggest granular edits [S14] (2026-04).\n\n### Communication & interop\n\n- The latent-communication thread passes continuous hidden states between agents on the premise that\n  downsampling thought to discrete tokens loses information \u2014 a heavily occupied lane [S17] (2025-11).\n- Protocol scope split a reviewer expects you to know: MCP = model\u2194tools/data (a single open standard replacing\n  per-source connectors); A2A = agent\u2194agent, explicitly complementary to MCP [S4] (2024-11) \u00b7 [S5] (2025-04).\n\n### Evaluation & economics\n\n- MAS eval has moved past final accuracy: MultiAgentBench (ACL 2025) scores collaboration quality with\n  milestone-based KPIs and compares coordination protocols (star / chain / tree / graph) [S20] (2025-03).\n- First independent (non-vendor) cost-accuracy Pareto: over 4 orchestration patterns \u00d7 5 LLMs on 10,000\n  financial documents, reflexive tops F1 (0.943) at 2.3\u00d7 cost; hierarchical supervisor-worker sits on the\n  Pareto frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4\u00d7) [S21] (2026-03).\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed)\n\n- Multi-Agent Verification: scale the NUMBER of off-the-shelf aspect verifiers (binary approve/reject, no\n  training) as the test-time axis \u2014 verification, not more debate rounds [S15] (2025-02).\n- The two production-craft poles, both vendor-staked (2025-06): Cognition \u2014 reliability = context engineering on\n  ONE thread [S19]; Anthropic \u2014 MAS pays off on parallel-heavy, context-exceeding, tool-heavy tasks at ~15\u00d7 token cost [S3].\n- Position line naming the comms tension: NL is structurally misaligned with LLM vector spaces \u2014\n  interpretability bought at an information cost [S18] (2025-06).\n\n## Durable core (the few foundations that still hold)\n\n- Du et al. 2023 \u2014 the founding \"debate improves reasoning\" result; the baseline the skeptic line attacks [S23].\n- Mixture-of-Agents \u2014 layered aggregation, each layer reads all prior-layer outputs; 65.1 vs 57.5 (GPT-4 Omni)\n  on AlpacaEval 2.0 \u2014 read as aggregation until cost-matched [S22].\n- MetaGPT \u2014 canonical role-crew/SOP assembly line; the hand-designed baseline learned methods must beat [S24].\n- LLMs cannot reliably self-correct reasoning without external feedback (ICLR 2024) [S16].\n- ADAS \u2014 the learned-topology transfer CLAIM (a meta agent programs new agents in code; claims cross-domain\n  robustness) \u2014 now directly contested, see Open questions [S11].\n- \"More Agents Is All You Need\" \u2014 agent-count scaling via sampling-and-voting; reread today as self-consistency [S25].\n\n## Already crowded \u2014 go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)\n\nThe blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:\n\n- Compute-matched \"does MAS beat a single agent per $\": benchmark wave + DPI theory + newest entrant showing\n  auto-generated MAS underperform CoT-SC at up to 10\u00d7 the cost \u2014 the field's loudest thread [S6] [S8].\n- Adaptive/learned topology AND its rebuttal: both the method line and the \"topological overfitting / illusory\n  coordination\" critique are published [S10] [S9].\n- Failure attribution (which agent/step): named benchmark plus a dense 2026 follow-on wave [S12].\n- Latent / vector inter-agent communication (hidden-state, KV-cache variants) \u2014 already has a unifying survey [S17].\n- Self-evolving / self-improving MAS: dense H1-2026 wave of frameworks that learn to evolve from execution\n  feedback, plus a dedicated survey [S14].\n- Building new interop protocols: MCP + A2A are standardized, vendor-backed, foundation-governed \u2014 compose on\n  them instead of proposing another [S4] [S5].\n\n## Open questions the field hasn't answered (the whole lens \u2014 the reader answers in their own way)\n\n1. Once inference compute, sample aggregation, and context-window relief are controlled, what residual \u2014 if\n   any \u2014 do the agentic ingredients (roles, personas, turn-taking, inter-agent dialogue) contribute, and on\n   which task families? The theory predicts MAS wins only under degraded context use or extra compute [S6] [S7];\n   no result yet isolates the residual itself.\n2. What makes a critique or verification signal genuinely EXTERNAL? Self-correction fails without external\n   feedback [S16], task verification is one of MAST's three failure categories [S1] \u2014 so does a same-family\n   peer critic count as external, and where exactly is the boundary?\n3. Same object, opposite 2026 verdicts: task-adaptive topology reports +12\u201323% at identical models [S10], while\n   independent evaluation finds adaptive MAS overfit topologically with illusory coordination [S9], and the\n   claimed cross-domain transfer of searched designs [S11] is measured as no advantage over CoT-SC [S8]. Under\n   what conditions does learned structure transfer, and what evaluation separates real coordination from\n   surface accuracy?\n4. Why do diagnosed failures rarely translate into structural self-improvement [S2]? Attribution is benchmarked\n   (best 53.5% [S12]) and typed blame signals exist [S1] \u2014 what is missing between a localized, typed fault and\n   a safe structural change (the survey's own closed-loop agenda [S2])?\n5. Can MAS reliability be predicted before running rather than measured after? Error propagation is the named\n   failure locus [S2], delay effects already yield instability thresholds and corrector-placement results [S13],\n   and a 1600+-trace corpus exists to fit against [S1] \u2014 yet there is no compositional account mapping\n   per-agent error rates + topology to system reliability.\n6. Is model-pool heterogeneity the actual mechanism behind reported multi-agent gains? It is the quoted\n   \"universal antidote\" and the named reopening condition for the buried debate line [S7] \u2014 would a\n   matched-compute heterogeneous pool beat self-consistency over the single best model?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ship another MAS framework: +X% on one benchmark, unmatched compute, no failure analysis | The rewarded move is a reusable diagnostic instrument \u2014 MAST, \"the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy\"; recognition = independent adoption (IBM applied it to turn raw ITBench traces into structured failure signatures) | problematizes-nothing \u2014 the field's own critique names weak baselines / limited coverage as the incremental signature | L\u00b7B | [S1] [S26] [S7] |\n| Homogeneous multi-agent debate as a reasoning booster | Buried (2025-02\u219206): MAD often loses to CoT/Self-Consistency at higher compute.

They work without any built-in web tools.\n\nWorkflow either way: **search** (discover) \u2192 **fetch** (read for the gist) \u2192\n**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).\n\n---\n\n## Running the scripts\n\nRun every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has\n`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:\n\n```bash\nexport SKILL_DIR=\"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools\"\nexport PY=\"$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python\"\n```\n\n### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)\n\n```bash\n# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss\n$PY \"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py\" --query \"neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM\" --max-results 10\n# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)\n$PY \"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py\" --query \"neuro-symbolic FOL translation\" --mode scholarly\n```\n\nReturns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses\nkeyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back\nto Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the\nlandscape; snippets are for discovery only \u2014 fetch a page before judging it.\n\n### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)\n\n```bash\n$PY \"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py\" fetch --url \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366\" --max-chars 10000\n```\n\n`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.\nHandles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.\n\n### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)\n\n```bash\n$PY \"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py\" grep --url \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366\" --pattern \"verbal reinforcement\" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200\n```\n\nReturns only the matching sections with surrounding context \u2014 the right tool\nfor exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary\nwould lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.\n\n**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a\nfetch after the search that produced its URL.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints\n  `Ability service not available`, the server is down \u2014 say so rather than\n  silently improvising a different search method.\n- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these\n  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep\n  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools`.

```
The user is asking me to generate a plan for an experiment artifact. Let me look at what I need to do:

1. I need to create a detailed plan for an experiment that measures self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths
2. The plan needs to be written as JSON to a specific file path
3. I should research the topic to make the plan concrete and actionable

Let me first check what tools I have available and look for any existing work from previous attempts. Let me also look at the user uploads folder for any relevant materials.

Looking at the previous attempt, it failed with "structured_output is None" - this suggests the previous agent didn't produce valid structured output. I need to make sure my plan is comprehensive and actionable.

Let me start by:
1. Checking user uploads for any relevant materials
2. Researching the topic to understand what datasets, models, and methods are appropriate
3. Creating a detailed, actionable plan
```

```
The web tools are being invoked but I'm not getting actual search results - it seems like the skill invocation is just returning the skill documentation, not executing the search. Let me try to use the built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools directly, or search for specific information I need.

Actually, looking at the previous attempts more carefully, it seems like there was a failure with "structured_output is None". This might be a tool calling issue. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for the specific information I need using the web tools properly.

Let me think about what I need for the plan:
1. GSM8K dataset structure - I already know from the skill docs: question, answer columns with math word problems
2. OpenRouter model selection - need a cheap but capable model that supports temperature=0.7
3. Related work on self-check divergence

Key information I have:
- GSM8K: openai/gsm8k, train split has 7,473 problems, question and answer columns
- OpenRouter has scripts for search, params, and calling
- Need to find a cheap model

Let me search for specific information about cheap models and the hypothesis.

3. Previous research on self-check divergence

I'll run the scripts directly.

```
I see the skill invocation just returns the skill description. Let me search for the actual scripts and models I need. I need to:

1. Search for cheap OpenRouter models that support temperature parameter
2. Search for relevant papers on self-check divergence

Let me use the scripts directly.

I see the web tools skill keeps returning its documentation. The built-in web search tools are not available (this is OpenHands). Let me use the scripts directly instead. Let me search for models and datasets.

Now I have enough information to write a detailed plan. Let me update the task status and create the plan.

Key decisions for the plan:
1. Dataset: GSM8K from HuggingFace - it's the standard benchmark for math reasoning, has clear answers that can be extracted
2. Model: Need a budget-efficient model with temperature support. I'll use Claude Haiku 4.5 or a similar low-cost model. Let me check the pricing - Claude Haiku 4.5 is $1/M in, $5/M out which is reasonable.
3. Three CoT lengths: short, medium, long - controlled via few-shot prompting style
4. Self-check: Independent re-evaluation without seeing the original CoT
5. Agreement rate: CoT answer vs self-check answer match or not
6. Gradual scaling: start with 5 problems (preview), then 50 (mini)

For the model selection, I should pick something cheap but capable. Let me look at what OpenRouter offers - I'll recommend using Claude Haiku 4.5 or a similar cost-effective model.

The plan needs to cover:
- Dataset preparation (GSM8K)
- Prompt design for three CoT lengths
- Self-check prompt design
- Agreement measurement
- Cost tracking
- Output format (method_out.json)
- Testing strategy
- Fallback plan

Let me write this plan now.

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Core Principles\n\n1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.\n2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.\n3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess \u2014 calculate.\n4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.\n5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.\n\n---\n\n## Gradual Scaling Sequence\n\nRun code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.\n\nSubstitute your actual file names:\n- `{mini_file}` \u2014 mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace\n- `{full_file}` \u2014 full dataset from dependency workspace\n- `{script}` \u2014 your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)\n- `{schema}` \u2014 JSON schema to validate output against\n\n**STEP 1 \u2014 MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.\n\n**STEP 2 \u2014 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2014 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear \u2014 account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.\n\n## Final Testing Phase\n\nAfter completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:\n\nmini \u2192 10 \u2192 50 \u2192 100 \u2192 200 \u2192 max\n\nAt each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.\n\n---\n\n## Background Execution\n\nFor any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:\n\n1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`\n2. While it runs, use the time productively:\n   - Sanity-check previous outputs\n   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)\n   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale\n   - Prepare the next step\n3. Check back on the background task to get results\n4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run\n\n---\n\n## Resource Limits\n\nSet hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).\n\nPython example using stdlib `resource` module:\n```python\nimport resource\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time\n```\nExceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAt each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-long-running-tasks`.

Now I have all the information I need to write a comprehensive experiment plan. Let me synthesize what I know:

1. **Hypothesis**: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning - as CoT length increases, agreement between CoT answer and self-check answer decreases
2. **Dataset**: GSM8K (openai/gsm8k) - 8.5K grade school math problems with questions and answers
3. **Model**: Need to find cheapest capable model on OpenRouter that supports temperature=0.7
4. **Approach**: 
   - Generate CoT at 3 lengths: short, medium, long
   - For each, generate independent self-check answer
   - Measure agreement rate
   - Track costs, use temperature=0.7 for stochastic sampling

Now I have enough information to write the experiment plan. Let me create the JSON plan file.

Key design decisions:
1. **Dataset**: GSM8K (openai/gsm8k) - confirmed available via HuggingFace
2. **Model**: Need a budget-efficient model with temperature support. Good candidates:
   - meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct (cheap, supports temperature)
   - google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 (very cheap, supports temperature)
   - mistralai/mistral-small-3.1 (affordable, supports temperature)
   I'll recommend a few options and let the executor choose based on current pricing.

3. **Approach**: 
   - 3 CoT lengths: short (concise), medium (default), long (detailed)
   - For each problem: generate CoT + self-check independently
   - Track agreement rate, accuracy, token count
   - Temperature=0.7 for stochasticity

4. **Gradual scaling**: 5 → 50 problems

5. **Budget**: $10 total on OpenRouter

6. **Output**: method_out.json with results
