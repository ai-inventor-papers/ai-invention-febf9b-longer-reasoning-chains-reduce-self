YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

### [3] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-08-19 16:50:47 UTC

````
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refining scope to acknowledge Zhou et al. flip events while carving out distinct cross-attempt measurement.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Acknowledged Zhou et al. (2026) as closely related prior work documenting flip events in extended reasoning traces
- >-
  Reframed novelty claim: self-check divergence measures agreement between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, distinct from
  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens
- >-
  Removed absolute claim of monotonic decline; now predicts decrease with acknowledgment of potential complexity
- >-
  Added qualification that this is a distinct reliability metric rather than replication of prior work
relation_type: evolution

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: research_iter2_dir2
type: research
objective: >-
  Find and synthesize 5 missing prior works flagged by reviewers, establishing the refined novelty gap for self-check divergence.
approach: >-
  Use aii-web-tools to search for and read 5 specific missing papers: (1) Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking
  in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739) — the most critical, as it studies flip events that closely resemble
  self-check divergence, (2) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970),
  (3) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017), (4) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability
  and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444), (5) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825). Also
  find Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models' for the correct CoT citation.
  For each paper: fetch the abstract and key results, extract their metrics and findings, and articulate exactly how self-check
  divergence is distinct. The key distinctions to establish: (a) Zhou et al. 2026 tracks flip events WITHIN a single extended
  trace (within-trace stability), while self-check divergence measures agreement BETWEEN two independent reasoning attempts
  (cross-path reproducibility), (b) Zhou et al. study reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while self-check
  divergence applies to standard CoT prompting, (c) their metric is marginal utility of tokens, while self-check agreement
  is a distinct reliability measure. Output research_out.json with: updated literature map covering all 12+ sources, refined
  novelty gap statement, and specific citation recommendations for the paper.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

  Use aii-web-tools to search for and read 5 specific missing papers: (1) Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking
  in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739) — the most critical, as it studies flip events that closely resemble
  self-check divergence, (2) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970),

  find Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models' for the correct CoT citation.
  For each paper: fetch the abstract and key results, extract their metrics and findings, and articulate exactly how self-check
  divergence is distinct. The key distinctions to establish: (a) Zhou et al. 2026 tracks flip events WITHIN a single extended
  trace (within-trace stability), while self-check divergence measures agreement BETWEEN two independent reasoning attempts
  (cross-path reproducibility), (b) Zhou et al. study reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while self-check
  divergence applies to standard CoT prompting, (c) their metric is marginal utility of tokens, while self-check agreement
  is a distinct reliability measure. Output research_out.json with: updated literature map covering all 12+ sources, refined
  novelty gap statement, and specific citation recommendations for the paper.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refining scope to acknowledge Zhou et al. flip events while carving out distinct cross-attempt measurement.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Acknowledged Zhou et al. (2026) as closely related prior work documenting flip events in extended reasoning traces
- >-
  Reframed novelty claim: self-check divergence measures agreement between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, distinct from
  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens
- >-
  Removed absolute claim of monotonic decline; now predicts decrease with acknowledgment of potential complexity
- >-
  Added qualification that this is a distinct reliability metric rather than replication of prior work

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refining scope to acknowledge Zhou et al. flip events while carving out distinct cross-attempt measurement.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Acknowledged Zhou et al. (2026) as closely related prior work documenting flip events in extended reasoning traces
- >-
  Reframed novelty claim: self-check divergence measures agreement between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, distinct from
  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens
- >-
  Removed absolute claim of monotonic decline; now predicts decrease with acknowledgment of potential complexity

  Added qualification that this is a distinct reliability metric rather than replication of prior work

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

id: research_iter2_dir2
type: research
objective: >-
  Find and synthesize 5 missing prior works flagged by reviewers, establishing the refined novelty gap for self-check divergence.
approach: >-
  Use aii-web-tools to search for and read 5 specific missing papers: (1) Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking
  in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739) — the most critical, as it studies flip events that closely resemble
  self-check divergence, (2) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970),
  (3) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017), (4) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability
  and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444), (5) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825). Also
  find Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models' for the correct CoT citation.
  For each paper: fetch the abstract and key results, extract their metrics and findings, and articulate exactly how self-check
  divergence is distinct. The key distinctions to establish: (a) Zhou et al. 2026 tracks flip events WITHIN a single extended
  trace (within-trace stability), while self-check divergence measures agreement BETWEEN two independent reasoning attempts
  (cross-path reproducibility), (b) Zhou et al. study reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while self-check
  divergence applies to standard CoT prompting, (c) their metric is marginal utility of tokens, while self-check agreement
  is a distinct reliability measure. Output research_out.json with: updated literature map covering all 12+ sources, refined
  novelty gap statement, and specific citation recommendations for the paper.

</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

  Find and synthesize 5 missing prior works flagged by reviewers, establishing the refined novelty gap for self-check divergence.
approach: >-
  Use aii-web-tools to search for and read 5 specific missing papers: (1) Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking
  in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739) — the most critical, as it studies flip events that closely resemble
  self-check divergence, (2) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970),
  (3) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017), (4) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability
  and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444), (5) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825). Also
  find Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models' for the correct CoT citation.
  For each paper: fetch the abstract and key results, extract their metrics and findings, and articulate exactly how self-check
  divergence is distinct. The key distinctions to establish: (a) Zhou et al. 2026 tracks flip events WITHIN a single extended
  trace (within-trace stability), while self-check divergence measures agreement BETWEEN two independent reasoning attempts
  (cross-path reproducibility), (b) Zhou et al. study reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while self-check
  divergence applies to standard CoT prompting, (c) their metric is marginal utility of tokens, while self-check agreement
  is a distinct reliability measure. Output research_out.json with: updated literature map covering all 12+ sources, refined
  novelty gap statement, and specific citation recommendations for the paper.

</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

Let me analyze the task carefully:

1. I'm a PLAN GENERATOR for a RESEARCH artifact
2. The hypothesis is about "Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning" - as CoT length increases, agreement between CoT answer and independent self-check decreases
3. The artifact direction asks me to find and synthesize 5 missing prior works to establish the refined novelty gap
4. I need to output a detailed PLAN (not execute it) as JSON

Let me first check what exists from previous attempts, then do some web research to make the plan concrete, and finally output the JSON plan.

Let me start by checking the current directory and any existing work.

2. The hypothesis is about "Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning" - as CoT length increases, agreement between CoT answer and independent self-check answer decreases
3. The artifact direction asks me to find and synthesize 5 missing prior works to establish the refined novelty gap

Let me plan this research task carefully. I need to:

1. Search for and read 5-6 specific papers related to the hypothesis on self-check divergence
2. Synthesize findings to establish the novelty gap
3. Output a detailed research plan for the executor

Let me start by searching for the key papers mentioned in the artifact direction. I'll do parallel searches for the most critical papers.
