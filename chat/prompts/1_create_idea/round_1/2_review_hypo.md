<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases monotonically — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional
  reasoning step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different
  generative path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. The effect is strongest for medium-difficulty
  problems where both the CoT and the self-check have non-trivial error rates.
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.

  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: free-first web search (general or scholarly, Serper fallback), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
