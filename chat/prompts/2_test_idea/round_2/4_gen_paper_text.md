# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design


[FIGURE:fig4]


The experimental pipeline is shown in Figure 4. For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

  Reframed novelty claim: self-check divergence measures agreement between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, distinct from
  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens

type: dataset
title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length
  and self-check disagreement—the core phenomenon our self-check divergence metric captures.

  novelty gap: no prior work measures cross-attempt agreement between independent CoT traces. Zhou 2026 tracks within-trace
  flip events (single trace growing longer); self-check divergence measures cross-path reproducibility (multiple independent
  attempts). Key distinctions: (1) Within-trace vs. cross-attempt: Zhou measures marginal utility within single trace; self-check
  divergence measures agreement between traces. (2) Consistency-as-noise vs. consistency-as-signal: Wan 2024 uses agreement
  for majority voting; self-check divergence uses disagreement as reliability signal. (3) Redundancy vs. contradiction: Nayab
  2024 measures verbosity; self-check divergence measures logical inconsistency. (4) Length-vs-accuracy vs. length-vs-agreement:
  Wu 2025 finds optimal length for accuracy but never measures whether shorter traces produce more consistent answers across
  attempts. This establishes a genuine novelty gap for self-check divergence as a reliability measurement dimension.

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design


[FIGURE:fig4]


The experimental pipeline is shown in Figure 4. For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length
  and self-check disagreement—the core phenomenon our self-check divergence metric captures.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design


[FIGURE:fig4]


The experimental pipeline is shown in Figure 4. For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length

Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design


[FIGURE:fig4]


The experimental pipeline is shown in Figure 4. For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

STEP 5 — HYPOTHESIS UPDATE: The hypothesis was revised based on evidence from previous iterations.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length
  and self-check disagreement—the core phenomenon our self-check divergence metric captures.

title: Research on 6 Prior Papers for Self-Check Divergence Novelty Gap
summary: >-
  Research investigating 6 key prior works on chain-of-thought reasoning, self-consistency, and reasoning length to establish
  novelty gap for self-check divergence hypothesis. Successfully verified 5 of 6 papers on arXiv. Identified that Kim 2026
  'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' was NOT found after extensive searches - potentially a fabricated or misattributed
  citation; replaced with Taubenfeld et al. (2025) 'Confidence Improves Self-Consistency' as closest real work. Confirmed
  novelty gap: no prior work measures cross-attempt agreement between independent CoT traces. Zhou 2026 tracks within-trace
  flip events (single trace growing longer); self-check divergence measures cross-path reproducibility (multiple independent
  attempts). Key distinctions: (1) Within-trace vs. cross-attempt: Zhou measures marginal utility within single trace; self-check
  divergence measures agreement between traces. (2) Consistency-as-noise vs. consistency-as-signal: Wan 2024 uses agreement
  for majority voting; self-check divergence uses disagreement as reliability signal. (3) Redundancy vs. contradiction: Nayab
  2024 measures verbosity; self-check divergence measures logical inconsistency. (4) Length-vs-accuracy vs. length-vs-agreement:
  Wu 2025 finds optimal length for accuracy but never measures whether shorter traces produce more consistent answers across
  attempts. This establishes a genuine novelty gap for self-check divergence as a reliability measurement dimension.

title: Research on 6 Prior Papers for Self-Check Divergence Novelty Gap
id: art_dqeO9CLW86P4
summary: >-
  Research investigating 6 key prior works on chain-of-thought reasoning, self-consistency, and reasoning length to establish
  novelty gap for self-check divergence hypothesis. Successfully verified 5 of 6 papers on arXiv. Identified that Kim 2026
  'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' was NOT found after extensive searches - potentially a fabricated or misattributed
  citation; replaced with Taubenfeld et al. (2025) 'Confidence Improves Self-Consistency' as closest real work. Confirmed
  novelty gap: no prior work measures cross-attempt agreement between independent CoT traces. Zhou 2026 tracks within-trace
  flip events (single trace growing longer); self-check divergence measures cross-path reproducibility (multiple independent
  attempts). Key distinctions: (1) Within-trace vs. cross-attempt: Zhou measures marginal utility within single trace; self-check
  divergence measures agreement between traces. (2) Consistency-as-noise vs. consistency-as-signal: Wan 2024 uses agreement
  for majority voting; self-check divergence uses disagreement as reliability signal. (3) Redundancy vs. contradiction: Nayab
  2024 measures verbosity; self-check divergence measures logical inconsistency. (4) Length-vs-accuracy vs. length-vs-agreement:
  Wu 2025 finds optimal length for accuracy but never measures whether shorter traces produce more consistent answers across
  attempts. This establishes a genuine novelty gap for self-check divergence as a reliability measurement dimension.

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output

algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,

# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design

For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

STEP 5 — HYPOTHESIS UPDATE: The hypothesis was revised based on evidence from previous iterations.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length
  and self-check disagreement—the core phenomenon our self-check divergence metric captures.

  Research investigating 6 key prior works on chain-of-thought reasoning, self-consistency, and reasoning length to establish
  novelty gap for self-check divergence hypothesis. Successfully verified 5 of 6 papers on arXiv. Identified that Kim 2026
  'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' was NOT found after extensive searches - potentially a fabricated or misattributed

  novelty gap: no prior work measures cross-attempt agreement between independent CoT traces. Zhou 2026 tracks within-trace
  flip events (single trace growing longer); self-check divergence measures cross-path reproducibility (multiple independent
  attempts). Key distinctions: (1) Within-trace vs. cross-attempt: Zhou measures marginal utility within single trace; self-check
  divergence measures agreement between traces. (2) Consistency-as-noise vs. consistency-as-signal: Wan 2024 uses agreement
  for majority voting; self-check divergence uses disagreement as reliability signal. (3) Redundancy vs. contradiction: Nayab
  2024 measures verbosity; self-check divergence measures logical inconsistency. (4) Length-vs-accuracy vs. length-vs-agreement:
  Wu 2025 finds optimal length for accuracy but never measures whether shorter traces produce more consistent answers across
  attempts. This establishes a genuine novelty gap for self-check divergence as a reliability measurement dimension.

  citation; replaced with Taubenfeld et al. (2025) 'Confidence Improves Self-Consistency' as closest real work. Confirmed
  novelty gap: no prior work measures cross-attempt agreement between independent CoT traces. Zhou 2026 tracks within-trace
  flip events (single trace growing longer); self-check divergence measures cross-path reproducibility (multiple independent
  attempts). Key distinctions: (1) Within-trace vs. cross-attempt: Zhou measures marginal utility within single trace; self-check
  divergence measures agreement between traces. (2) Consistency-as-noise vs. consistency-as-signal: Wan 2024 uses agreement
  for majority voting; self-check divergence uses disagreement as reliability signal. (3) Redundancy vs. contradiction: Nayab
  2024 measures verbosity; self-check divergence measures logical inconsistency. (4) Length-vs-accuracy vs. length-vs-agreement:
  Wu 2025 finds optimal length for accuracy but never measures whether shorter traces produce more consistent answers across
  attempts. This establishes a genuine novelty gap for self-check divergence as a reliability measurement dimension.

title: Statistical Analysis of Self-Check Divergence
id: art_K5SygwjbTyGp
summary: >-
  Evaluation artifact analyzing self-check divergence across chain-of-thought lengths. Parses experiment logs containing 1156
  results from GSM8K problems, performs statistical analyses including difficulty validation, 95% confidence intervals via
  bootstrap resampling, significance tests (McNemar's test p=0.0003, paired sign test p=0.0004, Spearman trend test rho=-0.116
  p=0.0008), divergence analysis between accuracy and agreement rates, Cohen's h effect sizes, and difficulty-stratified analysis.
  Key findings: short CoT agreement rate (68.1%) > medium (75.6%) > long (54.8%), with medium effect size (Cohen's h=0.27).
  Output conforms to exp_eval_sol_out schema with per-example evaluation metrics.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.

# Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has transformed how we elicit reasoning from large language models (LMs). By asking models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer, CoT has achieved dramatic improvements on benchmarks ranging from arithmetic word problems to logical reasoning tasks [1]. The success of CoT has spawned a family of verification-based methods—Chain-of-Verification [4], Self-Refine [5], and self-consistency [3]—that rely on the model's ability to independently re-evaluate its own reasoning. These methods share a critical assumption: that a model can reliably check its own work, and that longer reasoning chains produce answers that are more verifiable.

We challenge this assumption by identifying a phenomenon we call **self-check divergence**: as CoT length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer decreases monotonically—even when the CoT answer is correct. This creates a self-verification paradox: the model's own checking mechanism becomes less trustworthy precisely when it is most needed, on hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The problem is concrete and measurable. When a model generates a long CoT trace to solve a math problem, each reasoning step introduces small amounts of noise: arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, or factual approximations. When the same model is asked to independently re-evaluate the same problem without access to the original trace, it follows a different generative path. Our hypothesis is that the accumulated noise from the longer original trace makes the model's independent re-evaluation increasingly likely to disagree with the original answer, even when both the original and the re-evaluation are individually plausible.

This phenomenon matters for three reasons. First, it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines that are widely deployed to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy on exactly the problems where it is most needed. Second, it suggests that the relationship between CoT length and reliability is not monotonic in the way commonly assumed—there may be an optimal CoT length that maximizes both accuracy and internal consistency. Third, it provides a new metric for evaluating model reasoning quality: self-check agreement rate, which captures a dimension of reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

Our work differs from prior research in a critical way. Wu et al. [6] demonstrate that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve with CoT length, showing that errors accumulate exponentially as reasoning chains grow. However, they measure accuracy against ground truth, not internal consistency between reasoning and self-check. Wang et al. [3] show that self-consistency improves accuracy through majority voting across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only. No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length, distinguishing between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline.

Our contributions are:

1. **Self-check divergence metric.** We introduce a novel metric that measures the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as a function of CoT length, capturing a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure.

2. **Theoretical framework.** We propose a noise accumulation model grounded in numerical analysis (error diffusion), cognitive science (cognitive load theory), and information theory (signal-to-noise degradation) to explain why self-check divergence should increase monotonically with CoT length.

3. **Experimental framework.** We design a rigorous evaluation protocol using GSM8K [2] stratified into three difficulty tiers (easy, medium, hard) [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA], with controlled CoT lengths and independent re-evaluation, enabling systematic testing of the self-check divergence hypothesis.

4. **Literature synthesis.** We survey the CoT length, self-correction, and verification literature [ARTIFACT:art_Ys1K2HcN4b6h], establishing the novelty gap and positioning self-check divergence as a distinct phenomenon from accuracy decline.

# Related Work

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.** CoT prompting, introduced by Wei et al. [1], demonstrated that asking LMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on reasoning tasks. Subsequent work has explored variants including tree-of-thoughts [10], least-to-most prompting, and plan-and-solve prompting. These methods share the assumption that decomposing problems into steps improves reasoning quality.

**CoT Length and Accuracy.** Wu et al. [6] provide the most comprehensive analysis of CoT length effects, demonstrating that accuracy follows an inverted-U curve: performance initially improves as CoT appropriately decomposes the task, but deteriorates when CoT becomes excessively long due to error accumulation. They provide a theoretical model showing exponential error accumulation: A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N, where N is the number of steps. Ghosal et al. [9] corroborate this with test-time scaling experiments, showing non-monotonic accuracy patterns with extended thinking traces.

**Self-Verification Methods.** Chain-of-Verification [4] proposes a draft-verify-revise pipeline where the model generates verification questions to check its own answers. Self-Refine [5] iteratively refines outputs through self-feedback. Self-consistency [3] improves accuracy by sampling multiple reasoning paths and taking a majority vote. All of these methods assume that verification is reliable and that longer reasoning produces more verifiable answers—assumptions our work challenges.

**Self-Correction Limitations.** Kamoi et al. [7] survey 30+ self-correction papers and find that "no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs" in general tasks. They identify feedback generation as the bottleneck, noting that self-correction only works reliably with external tools, large-scale fine-tuning, or exceptionally favorable task properties. Our work extends this analysis by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback.

**Error Accumulation in Reasoning.** Havrilla & Iyer [8] distinguish static noise (local errors) from dynamic noise (propagating errors) in CoT traces, showing that dynamic noise is more destructive than static noise, with dynamic noise intensities above n_dl = 0.5 completely destroying performance. Our work extends this by measuring the downstream effect of accumulated noise on self-check agreement.

**The Novelty Gap.** No prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. Our self-check divergence metric fills this gap by quantifying the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement.

# Methodology

## Self-Check Divergence Metric

We define self-check agreement rate as the fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer. Formally, for a problem p, let a_CoT(p) be the answer produced by the model with a CoT trace of length L, and let a_check(p) be the answer produced when the same model re-evaluates p independently without access to the original trace. The self-check agreement rate at length L is:

SCA(L) = (1/|D|) · Σ_{p∈D} 1[a_CoT(p) = a_check(p)]

where D is the evaluation dataset. Self-check divergence is defined as the decrease in SCA(L) as L increases.

The key insight is that SCA(L) measures internal consistency, which is distinct from accuracy. A model can have high accuracy but low self-check agreement if its reasoning is fragile—correct on the first attempt but unable to reproduce the same answer when re-evaluating independently. Conversely, a model can have moderate accuracy but high self-check agreement if its reasoning is robust and reproducible.

## Noise Accumulation Model

We model self-check divergence as a consequence of error diffusion, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation. Each reasoning step i introduces a noise term ε_i with magnitude proportional to the step's complexity. The accumulated noise after N steps is:

ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j)

where δ_j represents the amplification factor at step j. When the model re-evaluates the problem independently, it generates a different sequence of noise terms ε'_i, leading to a different accumulated error and potentially a different final answer. The probability of agreement decreases as the variance of ε_total increases with N.

This model makes three testable predictions: (1) self-check agreement decreases monotonically with CoT length, (2) the effect is strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates, and (3) the decline in agreement is steeper than the decline in accuracy, as agreement requires two independent reasoning paths to converge.

## Experimental Design


[FIGURE:fig4]


The experimental pipeline is shown in Figure 4. For each GSM8K problem, the model generates a CoT answer at a controlled length, then independently re-evaluates the problem without access to the original trace. We evaluate self-check divergence using the GSM8K benchmark [2], a collection of 8,792 grade-school math word problems with verifiable numeric answers [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA]. Problems are stratified into three difficulty tiers using quantile-based binning on a composite difficulty score derived from operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning indicators:

- **Easy tier:** 2,930 problems (lowest difficulty quantile)
- **Medium tier:** 2,930 problems (middle difficulty quantile)
- **Hard tier:** 2,932 problems (highest difficulty quantile)


[FIGURE:fig2]


For each problem, we generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. For each CoT answer, we prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem without seeing the original CoT trace, and record the self-check answer. We measure three metrics:

1. **CoT accuracy:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the ground truth
2. **Self-check accuracy:** fraction of problems where the self-check answer matches the ground truth
3. **Self-check agreement rate:** fraction of problems where the CoT answer matches the self-check answer

The experimental design enables us to test whether self-check agreement decreases with CoT length even when accuracy is stable, and whether the effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems as predicted by our noise accumulation model.

# Predicted Results

Based on our hypothesis and noise accumulation model, we predict the following patterns:

**Monotonic decline in self-check agreement.** We expect SCA(L) to decrease monotonically as CoT length increases, with the steepest decline occurring at medium-to-long lengths where error accumulation becomes significant. This decline should be observable even when CoT accuracy is still high, revealing that internal consistency degrades before accuracy does.

**Difficulty-dependent divergence.** We predict that the self-check divergence effect will be strongest for medium-difficulty problems, where both the CoT and self-check have non-trivial error rates. For easy problems, both the CoT and self-check should agree frequently regardless of length. For hard problems, both should fail frequently, but the agreement rate should still decrease with length.

**Divergence from accuracy curves.** We predict that the self-check agreement curve will diverge from the accuracy curve: accuracy may follow an inverted-U pattern as reported by Wu et al. [6], while self-check agreement decreases monotonically. This divergence would demonstrate that internal consistency and accuracy capture different dimensions of reasoning quality.


[FIGURE:fig3]


The predicted results in Figure 3 illustrate the expected relationship between CoT length and the three metrics. The accuracy curve (dashed) follows an inverted-U pattern, peaking at medium CoT length. The self-check agreement curve (solid) decreases monotonically, demonstrating that internal consistency degrades even when accuracy is still improving. The gap between the two curves represents the self-check divergence phenomenon: problems where the model is accurate but internally inconsistent.

# Discussion

## Implications for Self-Verification Pipelines

Our hypothesis has direct implications for self-verification methods that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. Chain-of-Verification [4] assumes that independent verification is reliable, but our predicted results suggest that verification reliability decreases with reasoning length. This means that verification-based methods may be less effective on exactly the problems where they are most needed—hard problems that require long reasoning chains.

The self-check divergence phenomenon also challenges the assumption that longer reasoning is always better. If a model's own self-check cannot consistently reproduce its original answer on long CoT traces, then the model's confidence in that answer should be correspondingly lower. This suggests that verification-based methods should incorporate a measure of internal consistency as a confidence signal, not just a binary correct/incorrect check.

## Relationship to Prior Work

Our work extends the findings of Wu et al. [6] on error accumulation by showing that the accumulated error has measurable downstream effects on self-check agreement, not just on accuracy. It also extends the self-correction survey of Kamoi et al. [7] by quantifying how CoT length specifically affects the reliability of self-generated feedback. Unlike self-consistency [3], which measures agreement across samples at fixed length, our metric measures agreement as a function of length, revealing the dynamic relationship between reasoning depth and internal consistency.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated. The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data. Second, the GSM8K benchmark, while well-established, may not capture the full range of reasoning phenomena that contribute to self-check divergence. Third, our analysis focuses on a single model family; the effect may vary across model sizes and architectures. Finally, the difficulty stratification we use is heuristic, based on surface features rather than ground-truth difficulty labels.

## Future Work

Future work should empirically validate the self-check divergence hypothesis through the experimental framework we propose. Key directions include:

- **Empirical validation:** Run the proposed experiments across multiple model families and sizes to test whether the predicted monotonic decline in self-check agreement holds in practice.
- **Intervention studies:** Test whether interventions that reduce noise accumulation (e.g., step-by-step verification, structured reasoning formats) also reduce self-check divergence.
- **Application to verification pipelines:** Incorporate self-check agreement as a confidence signal in verification-based methods, potentially improving their reliability on hard problems.
- **Extension to other domains:** Test whether self-check divergence occurs in non-mathematical reasoning domains such as natural language inference, code generation, and scientific reasoning.

# Conclusion

We have introduced self-check divergence as a novel phenomenon in LLM reasoning: the decreasing agreement between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check answer as reasoning length increases. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that longer reasoning chains are more verifiable and reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines. Our noise accumulation model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why self-check divergence should increase with CoT length, and our experimental framework using GSM8K [ARTIFACT:art_x6HKmRkml2iA] provides a path for empirical validation. The self-check divergence metric captures a dimension of reasoning reliability that accuracy alone cannot measure, offering a new lens for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning systems.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper has NO empirical results. The entire 'Predicted Results' section states: 'The predicted curves in Figure 3 are based on the model's predictions, not on empirical data.' The paper acknowledges: 'our hypothesis is based on a theoretical model of noise accumulation that has not yet been empirically validated.' For a top-tier venue, a paper with only hypotheses and no experiments is essentially a research proposal, not a completed study. The dataset preparation code exists but there is no experiment code to actually run the self-check divergence measurement.
  Action: Execute the proposed experiments: for each GSM8K problem, generate CoT answers at controlled lengths (short/medium/long), then independently re-evaluate each problem without access to the original trace. Measure the three metrics (CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, self-check agreement rate) across lengths and difficulty tiers. Replace the 'Predicted Results' section with actual data. If the predicted patterns hold, the paper becomes a strong contribution. If they don't, the paper needs to be rethought around the actual findings.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misses Zhou et al. (2026) 'When More Thinking Hurts: Overthinking in LLM Test-Time Compute Scaling' (arXiv:2604.10739), which studies nearly identical phenomena. They track 'flip events' where models abandon correct answers with extended reasoning, show difficulty-stratified analysis (easy problems overthink earlier), and demonstrate diminishing marginal returns of additional thinking tokens. Their finding that 'extended reasoning is associated with abandoning previously correct answers' is essentially the self-check divergence phenomenon. This paper is not cited, and the novelty gap claim ('no prior work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length and self-check disagreement') is incorrect in light of this work.
  Action: Read and cite Zhou et al. (2026) in full. Rewrite the novelty section to acknowledge their work and articulate the specific distinction: (a) they track flip events within a single extended trace, while self-check divergence measures agreement between two independent reasoning attempts; (b) their analysis is on reasoning models (R1, s1) with forced token budgets, while this work could apply to standard CoT prompting; (c) their metric is marginal utility, while self-check agreement is a distinct reliability measure. Show what unique insight self-check divergence provides beyond their analysis.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) Several other closely related works are missing: (1) Kim et al. (2026) 'Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency' (ACL 2026, arXiv:2601.02970) studies response-level confidence for adaptive sampling, directly relevant to the reliability dimension; (2) Wan et al. (2024) 'Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency' (arXiv:2408.17017) uses reasoning path quality for early stopping; (3) Zhou et al. (2025) 'Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency' (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2510.15444) provides theoretical analysis of self-consistency estimation error; (4) Nayab et al. (2024) 'Concise Thoughts' (arXiv:2407.19825) studies output length impact on reasoning quality. The claim that 'no prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length' needs to be carefully qualified in light of these works.
  Action: Add all four papers to the related work section. For each, explain what they contribute and how self-check divergence is distinct. The novelty claim should be refined from 'no one has done this' to 'no one has measured self-check agreement between two independent reasoning attempts as a function of CoT length, distinguishing it from accuracy decline' — which is more defensible but still needs empirical support.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The noise accumulation model is mathematically underspecified. The formula ε_total = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ε_i · ∏_{j=i+1}^{N} (1 + δ_j) is presented without derivation, parameter definitions, or connection to observable quantities. What determines ε_i's distribution? How are δ_j estimated? The model makes three testable predictions but provides no mechanism for connecting the abstract formula to actual LLM behavior. This is not a rigorous theoretical framework — it is a qualitative narrative dressed in mathematical notation.
  Action: Either: (a) derive the formula from a formal model (e.g., a Markov chain of error propagation with empirically estimated transition probabilities), or (b) replace it with a simpler qualitative argument that doesn't pretend to be mathematical. If keeping the formula, define all parameters, show how they map to measurable quantities (e.g., step error rates), and ideally fit the model to preliminary data. A connection to Wu et al.'s A(N) = α[(1-T/C)·(1-T/(NM))]^N formula would strengthen the theoretical grounding.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The difficulty stratification uses heuristic surface features (operation count, numeric count, sentence count, token count, multi-step indicators) with arbitrary weights (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10). There is no validation that these scores correlate with actual problem difficulty as measured by model accuracy or human ratings. The paper acknowledges this limitation but proceeds with the unvalidated stratification as if it were ground truth. For the difficulty-dependent divergence prediction to be meaningful, the difficulty tiers need to be validated.
  Action: Validate the difficulty stratification by: (1) computing model accuracy on each tier and showing monotonic decline from easy to hard; (2) comparing against established difficulty ratings if available (e.g., the MATH dataset has level ratings); (3) performing sensitivity analysis showing that results are robust to different weighting schemes. At minimum, report the accuracy distribution across tiers to show the stratification captures meaningful difficulty variation.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) There is no experiment code in the artifacts. The dataset preparation code (data.py) correctly stratifies GSM8K problems, but there is no code that actually runs the self-check divergence experiment — no code for generating CoT answers at controlled lengths, no code for independent re-evaluation, no code for computing the three metrics. The paper describes an experimental protocol but provides no implementation.
  Action: Create experiment code that: (1) generates CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths using temperature-sampled inference; (2) independently re-evaluates each problem without access to the original trace; (3) computes CoT accuracy, self-check accuracy, and self-check agreement rate across lengths and difficulty tiers; (4) produces the figures showing the predicted curves. This code should be added as a new artifact.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Reference [1] cites Kojima et al. (2022) 'Large language models are zero-shot reasoners' as the original CoT paper. While Kojima et al. demonstrated zero-shot CoT, the standard citation for CoT prompting is Wei et al. (2022) 'Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.' The paper should cite Wei et al. as the original CoT work and Kojima et al. as the zero-shot variant, or at minimum clarify the distinction.
  Action: Add Wei et al. (2022) as the primary CoT citation and clarify the relationship to Kojima et al. (2022). This is a common citation issue that reviewers will notice.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper acknowledges testing only a single model family and notes that effects may vary across model sizes and architectures. While this is honest, it limits the generalizability of the findings. For a strong paper, results across at least 2-3 model families (e.g., different sizes of Llama, GPT, and Claude) would be needed to establish that self-check divergence is a general phenomenon rather than a model-specific artifact.
  Action: If running experiments, include at least 2-3 model families of different sizes. If resource constraints prevent this, acknowledge it more prominently and frame the findings as preliminary evidence rather than general conclusions.
- [MINOR] (methodology) The paper defines CoT length categories as 'short, medium, long' but does not specify what these mean in concrete terms (e.g., number of tokens, number of reasoning steps). The experimental design is vague on how length is controlled — is it through token limits, prompt engineering, or something else? This matters for reproducibility.
  Action: Define the CoT length categories precisely: specify the token ranges or step counts for 'short', 'medium', and 'long'. Describe the exact mechanism for controlling length (e.g., maximum token generation, forced continuation prompts, or early stopping). This is essential for reproducibility.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not discuss statistical significance testing. Even with empirical results, claims about monotonic decline and difficulty-dependent effects would need statistical support (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests). The current framework does not address how to distinguish real effects from random variation.
  Action: Add a statistical analysis plan: specify how confidence intervals will be computed (e.g., bootstrapping over problems), what significance tests will be used (e.g., paired t-tests for comparing agreement rates across lengths), and what effect sizes will be reported.

<hypothesis>
STEP 5 — HYPOTHESIS UPDATE: The hypothesis was revised based on evidence from previous iterations.

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:

  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.

  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve

    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

title: Survey of self-check divergence and CoT length literature
summary: >-
  This research artifact surveys 7 primary sources across 4 thematic areas to establish the novelty gap for the self-check
  divergence metric. Key findings: (1) Wu et al. [2] demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve between CoT length and accuracy,
  with exponential error accumulation, but only measure accuracy—not self-check agreement. (2) Zhang et al. [4] find that
  self-correction rarely works without external feedback, identifying feedback generation as the bottleneck. (3) Havrilla
  & Iyer [7] show dynamic noise (propagating errors) is more destructive than static noise in CoT traces. (4) Wang et al.
  [6] show self-consistency improves accuracy via majority vote across samples, but measure agreement at fixed length only.
  (5) Ghosal et al. [5] show parallel thinking outperforms sequential extension, but don't track agreement rates across lengths.
  The novelty gap: NO prior work measures self-check agreement rate as a function of CoT length. No work distinguishes between
  accuracy decline and internal consistency decline. No work quantifies the monotonic relationship between reasoning length
  and self-check disagreement—the core phenomenon our self-check divergence metric captures.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.
