<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:
- >-
  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.
- >-
  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.
- >-
  SEER (Huang et al., 2025): Longer CoT causes truncation and accuracy drops. DIFFERENCE: They focus on truncation and accuracy;
  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-
  Havrilla & Iyer (2024): Dynamic noise propagates in CoT traces. DIFFERENCE: They study noise in TRAINING DATA; we study
  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

type: experiment
objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths using GSM8K, producing the core empirical curve for
  the paper.
approach: >-
  Use the mini GSM8K dataset (51 problems, balanced across easy/medium/hard tiers). Select a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct or mistral-large). For each problem, generate CoT answers at three controlled lengths
  using distinct prompt instructions: (1) SHORT: 'Solve this concisely in 2-3 steps' targeting ~50-100 reasoning tokens, (2)
  MEDIUM: 'Solve this step by step, showing your work' targeting ~150-300 reasoning tokens, (3) LONG: 'Solve this in extreme
  detail, showing every intermediate calculation and reasoning step' targeting ~400-700 reasoning tokens. Use temperature=0.7
  for stochastic sampling. For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the same problem WITHOUT
  seeing the original CoT trace, producing a self-check answer. Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, ground truth, whether
  CoT matches ground truth (accuracy), whether self-check matches ground truth (self-check accuracy), whether CoT matches
  self-check (agreement rate), and actual token counts for each trace. Start with the preview dataset (5 problems) to validate
  the pipeline end-to-end, then scale to the full mini dataset (51 problems) using gradual scaling. Track cumulative LLM API
  cost after every call and STOP if approaching $10 budget. Output method_out.json containing: per-problem results (problem_id,
  difficulty_tier, cot_length, cot_answer, check_answer, ground_truth, cot_correct, check_correct, agree, cot_tokens, check_tokens),
  aggregate metrics (accuracy and agreement rate by length and difficulty tier), and raw cost tracking.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check

  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).

  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)

  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.

  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths using GSM8K, producing the core empirical curve for

  Use the mini GSM8K dataset (51 problems, balanced across easy/medium/hard tiers). Select a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct or mistral-large). For each problem, generate CoT answers at three controlled lengths

  MEDIUM: 'Solve this step by step, showing your work' targeting ~150-300 reasoning tokens, (3) LONG: 'Solve this in extreme

  seeing the original CoT trace, producing a self-check answer. Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, ground truth, whether
  CoT matches ground truth (accuracy), whether self-check matches ground truth (self-check accuracy), whether CoT matches

YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:

  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.

  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.

  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.

  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens

  Removed absolute claim of monotonic decline; now predicts decrease with acknowledgment of potential complexity

objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths using GSM8K, producing the core empirical curve for
  the paper.
approach: >-
  Use the mini GSM8K dataset (51 problems, balanced across easy/medium/hard tiers). Select a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct or mistral-large). For each problem, generate CoT answers at three controlled lengths
  using distinct prompt instructions: (1) SHORT: 'Solve this concisely in 2-3 steps' targeting ~50-100 reasoning tokens, (2)
  MEDIUM: 'Solve this step by step, showing your work' targeting ~150-300 reasoning tokens, (3) LONG: 'Solve this in extreme
  detail, showing every intermediate calculation and reasoning step' targeting ~400-700 reasoning tokens. Use temperature=0.7
  for stochastic sampling. For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the same problem WITHOUT
  seeing the original CoT trace, producing a self-check answer. Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, ground truth, whether
  CoT matches ground truth (accuracy), whether self-check matches ground truth (self-check accuracy), whether CoT matches
  self-check (agreement rate), and actual token counts for each trace. Start with the preview dataset (5 problems) to validate
  the pipeline end-to-end, then scale to the full mini dataset (51 problems) using gradual scaling. Track cumulative LLM API
  cost after every call and STOP if approaching $10 budget. Output method_out.json containing: per-problem results (problem_id,
  difficulty_tier, cot_length, cot_answer, check_answer, ground_truth, cot_correct, check_correct, agree, cot_tokens, check_tokens),
  aggregate metrics (accuracy and agreement rate by length and difficulty tier), and raw cost tracking.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable

objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths using GSM8K, producing the core empirical curve for
  the paper.
approach: >-
  Use the mini GSM8K dataset (51 problems, balanced across easy/medium/hard tiers). Select a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct or mistral-large). For each problem, generate CoT answers at three controlled lengths
  using distinct prompt instructions: (1) SHORT: 'Solve this concisely in 2-3 steps' targeting ~50-100 reasoning tokens, (2)
  MEDIUM: 'Solve this step by step, showing your work' targeting ~150-300 reasoning tokens, (3) LONG: 'Solve this in extreme
  detail, showing every intermediate calculation and reasoning step' targeting ~400-700 reasoning tokens. Use temperature=0.7
  for stochastic sampling. For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the same problem WITHOUT
  seeing the original CoT trace, producing a self-check answer. Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, ground truth, whether
  CoT matches ground truth (accuracy), whether self-check matches ground truth (self-check accuracy), whether CoT matches
  self-check (agreement rate), and actual token counts for each trace. Start with the preview dataset (5 problems) to validate
  the pipeline end-to-end, then scale to the full mini dataset (51 problems) using gradual scaling. Track cumulative LLM API
  cost after every call and STOP if approaching $10 budget. Output method_out.json containing: per-problem results (problem_id,
  difficulty_tier, cot_length, cot_answer, check_answer, ground_truth, cot_correct, check_correct, agree, cot_tokens, check_tokens),
  aggregate metrics (accuracy and agreement rate by length and difficulty tier), and raw cost tracking.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant

Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Check Divergence in Long Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  As chain-of-thought length increases, the agreement rate between a model's CoT-derived answer and its independent self-check
  answer decreases — even when the CoT answer is correct. This 'self-check divergence' occurs because each additional reasoning
  step introduces small noise that accumulates, causing the model's independent re-evaluation (which follows a different generative
  path) to increasingly disagree with the original CoT conclusion. While Zhou et al. (2026) document 'flip events' where models
  abandon correct answers within extended single traces under forced token budgets, self-check divergence measures agreement
  between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, capturing a distinct reliability dimension (cross-path reproducibility) rather
  than within-trace stability. The effect is predicted to be strongest for medium-difficulty problems where both the CoT and
  the self-check have non-trivial error rates, and should be observable across standard CoT prompting (not limited to reasoning
  models with forced compute).
motivation: >-
  This hypothesis matters because it reveals a fundamental limitation in self-verification pipelines (like Chain-of-Verification)
  that are widely used to improve LLM reliability. If longer reasoning chains produce answers that the model itself cannot
  consistently reproduce when re-evaluating independently, then self-verification becomes less trustworthy precisely when
  it is most needed — on hard problems that require long reasoning. This has implications for building reliable AI systems,
  designing better verification protocols, and understanding the limits of LLM self-correction.
assumptions:
- >-
  LLMs generate stochastically, so re-evaluating the same problem independently produces a different reasoning path.
- >-
  Each reasoning step in a CoT introduces small amounts of noise (e.g., arithmetic slips, logical shortcuts, factual approximations).
- >-
  The model's independent self-check does not have access to the original CoT trace, so it must reason from scratch.
- >-
  The noise accumulation is non-linear: small errors in early steps propagate and amplify through later steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Select a benchmark of verifiable problems (e.g., GSM8K math problems, logical reasoning tasks). 2) For each problem,
  generate CoT answers at multiple controlled lengths (short, medium, long) using temperature-sampled inference. 3) For each
  CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the problem WITHOUT seeing the original CoT, and record the
  self-check answer. 4) Measure the agreement rate (CoT answer matches self-check answer) as a function of CoT length. 5)
  Compare against accuracy curves to show that self-check divergence can occur even when accuracy is stable. 6) Use multiple
  model sizes to test whether the effect scales with model capability.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) Self-check agreement rate decreases monotonically with CoT length, (b) The decline is statistically significant
  across multiple problem types, (c) The effect persists even when CoT accuracy is high (showing divergence is distinct from
  inaccuracy), (d) The effect is amplified for medium-difficulty problems. DISCONFIRMED if: (a) Agreement rate is flat or
  increases with CoT length, (b) Agreement rate tracks accuracy perfectly with no independent divergence signal.
related_works:

  When More is Less (Wu et al., 2025): Shows inverted-U curve for accuracy vs CoT length. DIFFERENCE: They measure accuracy
  (match to ground truth); we measure self-check agreement (internal consistency), which can diverge from accuracy.
- >-
  Dark Side of Self-Correction (Zhang et al., 2024): Shows self-correction can cause models to waver and introduce bias. DIFFERENCE:
  They study self-correction failures qualitatively; we quantify the relationship between CoT length and self-check divergence
  as a measurable curve.

  Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023): Draft-verify-revise pipeline. DIFFERENCE: They assume verification is reliable;
  we show verification reliability DECREASES with reasoning length.

  we focus on internal consistency between reasoning and self-check.
- >-

  noise accumulation during INFERENCETIME reasoning that causes self-check divergence.
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain sources: (1) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS — error diffusion: each computational step accumulates rounding errors,
  so long computation chains produce results that differ from independent recomputation. (2) COGNITIVE SCIENCE — cognitive
  load theory: as working memory load increases with more reasoning steps, consistency between initial judgment and re-evaluation
  degrades. (3) INFORMATION THEORY — signal-to-noise ratio degradation: each token adds noise that eventually dominates the
  signal, making independent reproduction of the same conclusion less likely.
terms:
- term: Self-Check Divergence
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where a model's independent re-evaluation of a problem produces a different answer than its original chain-of-thought
    reasoning, with the disagreement rate increasing as the CoT lengthens.
- term: Self-Check Agreement Rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of problems where a model's independent re-evaluation answer matches its original CoT-derived answer.
- term: Error Diffusion
  definition: >-
    The process by which small errors introduced at each step of a reasoning chain accumulate and amplify through subsequent
    steps, analogous to rounding error accumulation in numerical computation.
- term: Independent Re-Evaluation
  definition: >-
    Asking the same model to solve the same problem from scratch without access to its original reasoning trace, producing
    a fresh answer for comparison.
- term: Inverted-U Curve
  definition: >-
    A performance pattern where accuracy first increases then decreases as a function of some variable (here, CoT length),
    as reported by Wu et al. (2025).
summary: >-
  Longer chain-of-thought reasoning causes a model's independent self-check to increasingly disagree with its own original
  answer, creating a self-verification paradox where the model's own checking mechanism becomes less reliable on problems
  requiring more reasoning steps.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refining scope to acknowledge Zhou et al. flip events while carving out distinct cross-attempt measurement.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Acknowledged Zhou et al. (2026) as closely related prior work documenting flip events in extended reasoning traces
- >-
  Reframed novelty claim: self-check divergence measures agreement between TWO INDEPENDENT reasoning attempts, distinct from
  within-trace flip analysis
- >-
  Added distinction along three dimensions: (a) two independent attempts vs. single trace, (b) standard CoT prompting vs.
  forced-compute reasoning models, (c) cross-attempt agreement vs. marginal utility of tokens
- >-
  Removed absolute claim of monotonic decline; now predicts decrease with acknowledgment of potential complexity

  Added qualification that this is a distinct reliability metric rather than replication of prior work

objective: >-
  Measure self-check agreement rate across three controlled CoT lengths using GSM8K, producing the core empirical curve for
  the paper.
approach: >-
  Use the mini GSM8K dataset (51 problems, balanced across easy/medium/hard tiers). Select a budget-efficient model via OpenRouter
  (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct or mistral-large). For each problem, generate CoT answers at three controlled lengths
  using distinct prompt instructions: (1) SHORT: 'Solve this concisely in 2-3 steps' targeting ~50-100 reasoning tokens, (2)
  MEDIUM: 'Solve this step by step, showing your work' targeting ~150-300 reasoning tokens, (3) LONG: 'Solve this in extreme
  detail, showing every intermediate calculation and reasoning step' targeting ~400-700 reasoning tokens. Use temperature=0.7
  for stochastic sampling. For each CoT answer, prompt the same model to independently re-evaluate the same problem WITHOUT
  seeing the original CoT trace, producing a self-check answer. Record: CoT answer, self-check answer, ground truth, whether
  CoT matches ground truth (accuracy), whether self-check matches ground truth (self-check accuracy), whether CoT matches
  self-check (agreement rate), and actual token counts for each trace. Start with the preview dataset (5 problems) to validate
  the pipeline end-to-end, then scale to the full mini dataset (51 problems) using gradual scaling. Track cumulative LLM API
  cost after every call and STOP if approaching $10 budget. Output method_out.json containing: per-problem results (problem_id,
  difficulty_tier, cot_length, cot_answer, check_answer, ground_truth, cot_correct, check_correct, agree, cot_tokens, check_tokens),
  aggregate metrics (accuracy and agreement rate by length and difficulty tier), and raw cost tracking.

title: GSM8K Math Problems With Difficulty Tiers
summary: >-
  This artifact provides the GSM8K dataset (openai/gsm8k) prepared for a self-check divergence experiment investigating whether
  shorter chain-of-thought reduces contradiction in model self-checks. The dataset contains 8,792 math word problems (7,473
  train + 1,319 test splits) from the well-established GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al. 2021, 281+ citations, 1M+ downloads on
  HuggingFace). Each problem has a verifiable numeric answer extracted from the standard #### format. Problems are stratified
  into three balanced difficulty tiers (2,930 easy, 2,930 medium, 2,932 hard) using quantile-based binning on a composite
  difficulty score derived from: operation count, numeric complexity, sentence count, token length, and multi-step reasoning
  indicators. The output follows the exp_sel_data_out schema with per-example metadata including difficulty_tier, difficulty_score,
  solution_steps, and feature counts. Three file variants are provided: full (8,792 examples), mini (51 examples, balanced
  tiers), and preview (5 examples). The dataset is ideal for the experiment because: (1) each problem has a unique verifiable
  answer enabling contradiction detection, (2) difficulty stratification allows testing across problem complexity, (3) linguistic
  diversity ensures generalization, and (4) the established benchmark provides a familiar evaluation context.

# Mechanistic interpretability — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: the FIELD of mechanistic interpretability — what a mechanistic claim is, how it is
validated, and where the frontier sits mid-2026. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions.
This is the SOLE interpretability handbook: SAE-era decomposition
primitives are covered here as one thread of six rather than in a separate deep-dive.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- The field defines itself by **goal, not method**: understand computational mechanisms "in order
  to accomplish concrete scientific and engineering goals" [S1].
- Its own venue prints a **two-track evidence bar**: either "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and
  how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or "clear practical benefits over
  well-implemented baselines" [S14].
- One methodological critique reframes findings as **statistical estimates, not properties**: the
  causal effect of a component is "a volatile random variable rather than a fixed property" [S4].
- **Structure is not mechanism.** Discovery algorithms "sample from an equivalence class of valid
  subgraphs rather than recovering a unique mechanism" [S23].
- **Causal abstraction is vacuous without an encoding assumption**: with unrestricted alignment maps,
  "any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm" [S5].
- The artifact a reader gets is a **hypothesis about the model, not a description of it** —
  attribution graphs (Anthropic) run on a replacement model and give satisfying insight on about
  "a quarter of the prompts" [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Validity & stability of the method itself** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- Circuit discovery is unstable under small perturbations: "small perturbations in input data
  or hyperparameters yield vastly different circuits" [S4] (2025-10, rev 2026-05).
- Phantom specialization: across 75 circuits in five Pythia models, structural differences showed
  "apparent specialization but do not correspond to functional differences" [S23] (2026-06).
- The workhorse approximation was diagnosed — attribution patching's "dominant error stems from the
  non-linearities in the downstream network rather than local curvature at the patched component",
  with a correction in the same paper [S19] (2026-06).

**Intrinsic interpretability (train-for-interpretability)**

- Weight-sparse transformers yield understandable circuits, but "making weights sparser trades off
  capability for interpretability", and "scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero
  parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge" [S18] (2025-11).
- The newest entrant flips the unit from behavior to parameter, asking "whether a single weight can
  be understood globally across the full training distribution" [S2] (2026-07, four models only).

**Evaluation & standardization**

- MIB is a standardized method-comparison benchmark: on causal variable localization "the supervised DAS method
  performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons" [S10] (ICML 2025), extended to a
  community shared task whose framing admission stands — "measuring progress in MI remains
  challenging" [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).
- Randomized baselines invalidate the auto-interp proxy: SAEs on randomly initialized transformers
  score similarly to trained ones [S9] (2025-01, rev 2026-01).

**Decomposition primitives (the SAE era, and after)**

- The sparsity objective is itself a distorting inductive bias: feature absorption "is caused by
  optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy", so
  "SAE latents may be inherently unreliable classifiers" [S30] (NeurIPS 2025 Oral).
- The single latent is not a canonical unit — SAE stitching shows dictionaries are incomplete and
  meta-SAEs show they are "not atomic" [S33] (ICLR 2025); seed-unstable latents concentrate in
  "reproducible lower-rank subspaces", i.e. basis ambiguity rather than noise [S35] (2026-06).
- The raw-latent verdict a reviewer will cite: on steering "prompting outperforms all existing
  methods" and on detection difference-in-means wins — "SAEs are not competitive" [S31] (2025-01);
  contested, but only by an unreviewed supervised-pipeline rebuttal [S25].
- Proxy metrics are the field's own named weak point: "gains on proxy metrics do not reliably
  translate to better practical performance" [S32] (ICML 2025).
- Model diffing has a known-bad default: the crosscoder L1 loss "can misattribute concepts as unique
  to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models"; the same paper ships the BatchTopK
  fix [S34] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The flagship open fleet has already moved past SAE-only — Gemma Scope 2 ships "transcoders,
  cross-layer transcoders, and crosscoders" alongside SAEs [S36] (2025-12).

**Reasoning-trace interpretability**

- Faithfulness and monitorability come apart: "models can appear faithful yet remain hard to
  monitor when they leave out key factors" [S12] (2025-10).
- The dominant unfaithfulness metric is contested — it "confuses unfaithfulness with
  incompleteness", and "the absence of hint words alone does not prove unfaithfulness" [S13]
  (2025-12, rev 2026-05).

**Applied / safety-facing interpretability**

- Persona vectors (Anthropic) predict and pre-empt training-induced trait shifts, and "flag training data that
  will produce undesirable personality changes" [S16] (2025-07) — the clearest applied win.
- A blinded audit protocol exists: three of four teams "successfully uncovered the model's hidden
  objective", SAEs among the techniques used [S17] (2025-03).
- Counter-current, and the sharpest 2026 negative result — internal decodability far exceeded output
  behaviour: "Linear probes discriminated hazardous from benign cases with 98.2% AUROC, yet the
  model's output sensitivity was only 45.1%, a 53-percentage-point knowledge-action gap." SAE
  feature steering "produced zero effect despite 3,695 significant features", and steering was
  "indistinguishable from random perturbation" [S3] (2026-03; 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes,
  one clinical domain).

**Field strategy & meta-science**

- A frontier lab publicly narrowed its bet — "We have been disappointed by the amount of progress
  made by ambitious mech interp work, from both us and others", and "We made a decision to
  deprioritise SAE research as a result, not because we thought the technique was useless" [S6]
  (2025-12). One team's decision, not a field verdict.
- Results are not yet comparable across papers: two studies reached "conflicting conclusions for the
  same behavior", a third found both "partially correct but incomparable" [S8] (2026-04).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- The field's own review concedes "there are many open problems in the field that require solutions
  before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized" [S1] (2025-01), and the LRM sub-map
  names the same gaps [S24]. The two framings a reviewer will invoke: "the returns from
  interpretability have been roughly nonexistent" [S7] (2025-05), against "We are thus in a race
  between interpretability and model intelligence." [S15] (2025-04) — a stated goal, not a result.
- Durable: activation patching remains the gold-standard causal metric faster methods approximate [S19];
  attribution graphs remain the scaling story, with their stated ceiling [S11].

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Circuit-discovery methods and their corrections.** Attribution patching, its error diagnosis and
  second-order fix [S19], structural-vs-functional decoupling [S23], and an eight-method community
  bake-off [S22] are all published.
- **Auto-interp / agentic feature explanation.** Both the agentic pipeline [S21] and the
  randomized-baseline invalidation of its metrics [S9] already exist.
- **Activation steering and its reliability diagnostics.** Per-sample unreliability and the
  linear-approximation limit are characterized [S20]; the AxBench verdict
  already has a published rebuttal [S25].
- **CoT faithfulness / monitorability metrics.** The measurement wave [S12] and the
  metric-invalidating counter-wave [S13] have both landed.
- **Benchmarking MI methods against each other.** MIB [S10] plus its shared-task extension [S22]
  own this; a new leaderboard re-treads it.
- **Developmental / training-dynamics interpretability.** Feature evolution is already tracked
  across pre-training snapshots with crosscoders [S28] (ICLR 2026).
- **Training-data attribution as an interpretability method.** Already explicitly bridged to MI and
  causally validated on Pythia [S26].
- **Multimodal / vision-language mechanistic interpretability.** Has its own survey and taxonomy
  since 2025-02 [S27].
- **Mechanistic interpretability of RL-trained reasoning models.** Occupied through 2026 — temporal
  sparse autoencoders already track feature dynamics across RLVR training [S29].
- **Sparse-dictionary decomposition of activations.** The most-worked lane in the field: SAE features
  are "not better than neurons" on MIB [S10], the auto-interp metrics used to defend them fail a
  randomized baseline [S9], absorption is traced to the objective itself [S30], canonical-unit claims
  are refuted [S33], and the raw-latent steering/detection verdict plus its rebuttal are both
  published [S31] [S25].

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. If exact single-input causal scores are volatile random variables [S4] and structurally distinct
   circuits implement one computation [S23], **what object is circuit discovery actually estimating,
   and at what granularity is a "mechanism" even well-defined?** The field's standard output — one
   circuit, one figure — presupposes an answer it has not given.
2. Causal abstraction is vacuous without a constraint on how models encode information [S5]. What
   would make such an encoding assumption testable independently of the claim it licenses?
3. Near-perfect internal decodability coexists with a large knowledge-action gap and steering
   indistinguishable from random perturbation [S3]. What would have to hold for "we understand it"
   to imply "we can change it" — and is that implication load-bearing for the field's stated
   goals [S1]?
4. Two verdicts clash: the returns are "roughly nonexistent" [S7], yet the same window produced
   deployed applied results [S16] [S17]. On what measure are both true, and which should a paper
   report?
5. Two studies reached conflicting conclusions on one behavior and a third found both partially
   right but incomparable [S8]. What makes two mechanistic findings comparable at all, and can that
   be settled without a standard the field does not yet have?
6. Interpretability is bought at a stated capability cost with a scaling ceiling [S18], while
   auto-interp scores fail to separate trained from random networks [S9]. What is the exchange rate
   between understandability and capability, and who should be willing to pay it?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship a new circuit/feature method that improves a proxy metric on one task. | The rewarded move meets the venue's own bar: state "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or show "clear practical benefits over well-implemented baselines". Recognition signal: a NeurIPS 2025 **Spotlight** went to a result proving the field's own framework vacuous when generalized [S5]. | problematizes-nothing — proxy-metric progress reads incremental in 2026 | L·A | [S14] [S5] |
| Treat a high auto-interpretability or reconstruction score as evidence that real features were recovered. | **Buried (2025-01, rev 2026-01):** the same scores appear on randomly initialized transformers [S9]. Reopening condition, stated there: routine randomized baselines plus targeted measures of feature abstractness. | wrong-result — the metric does not discriminate the thing it is used to claim | L | [S9] |
| Report one circuit, from one extraction, one seed, one input distribution, as *the* mechanism. | **Buried (2025-10 → 2026-06):** effects are volatile random variables [S4]; structure-to-function is many-to-one [S23]. Reopening condition: edge-level evaluation plus cross-condition transfer tests. | wrong-result — a single-draw circuit is an unreported sample from an equivalence class | L | [S4] [S23] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** unusually, it prints BOTH bars in one
> sentence [S14] — a falsifiable mechanistic claim, or a demonstrated practical benefit over strong
> baselines. What clears neither is a method with a better proxy score and no falsifiable
> hypothesis attached [S9] [S22].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Report a circuit from one seed/hyperparameter/input set. | Designing the run: sample across seeds, hyperparameters and input distributions; report the distribution and stability metrics, not the modal circuit. | wrong-result — single-config circuits are unstable | L | [S4] |
| Read structural difference between two circuits as two mechanisms. | Before claiming distinct mechanisms: run edge-level evaluation and cross-condition transfer; source-level evaluation inflates apparent faithfulness. | wrong-result — phantom specialization | L | [S23] |
| Use attribution patching scores as ground truth at scale. | When approximating: screen with a reliability score and correct the leading term; expect downstream non-linearity, not local curvature, to dominate the error. | wrong-result — the evidence for the circuit is itself mis-specified | L | [S19] |
| Validate an interpretation with a freely-parameterized alignment map. | Stating the claim: fix and declare the map class, and make the encoding assumption explicit — unconstrained maps hit 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on randomly initialized models. | wrong-result — a perfect fit that means nothing | L | [S5] |
| Use a raw SAE latent as a classifier or steering target. | Choosing the unit: benchmark against difference-in-means and a prompting ceiling before claiming a latent works; expect absorption to make single latents unreliable where features are hierarchical. | wrong-result — the raw-latent verdict is the field's default prior | L | [S31] [S30] |
| Read a crosscoder model-diff at face value. | Diffing two models: use BatchTopK rather than L1 and presence-test any "unique to the fine-tune" latent — the artifact is a property of the loss. | wrong-result — the loss fabricates unique-to-finetune latents | L | [S34] |
| Score SAE/dictionary features against nothing. | Choosing the comparison: benchmark against non-featurized hidden vectors (neurons) and supervised DAS on MIB's tracks. | wrong-result — featurization may add zero | L | [S10] |
| Report auto-interp scores as the validity evidence. | Reporting: add a randomized-transformer arm; treat aggregate auto-interp as a proxy, never as recovery evidence. | wrong-result — untrained networks pass | L | [S9] |
| Claim a steering result from a mean effect at one coefficient. | Reporting steering: give the per-sample distribution and the behaviors where it fails; effect sizes "vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors". | wrong-result — the mean hides the failure regime | L | [S20] |
| Call a CoT unfaithful because it omits a hint that changed the answer. | Judging traces: separate unfaithfulness from incompleteness, and pair hint-based metrics with causal mediation. | wrong-result — the metric over-reports | L | [S13] [S12] |
| Claim interpretability *enables* correction because the information is decodable. | Closing the loop: measure output-level correction AND collateral disruption of already-correct cases, against a random-perturbation control. | wrong-result — decodability ≠ actionability | L | [S3] |

## Decision guide

- **Which primitive for which question:** components and their interactions → circuit localization
  (attribution / mask optimization lead on MIB); an interpretable variable inside a hidden vector →
  causal variable localization (supervised DAS leads; SAE features do not beat neurons) [S10].
- **Post-hoc vs trained-for-interpretability:** post-hoc buys you the deployed model; weight-sparse
  training buys understandability at a capability cost and stops scaling in the tens of millions of
  nonzero parameters [S18].
- **Auditing claims:** in the reference blinded protocol, three of four teams succeeded, leaning on
  several technique families together rather than interpretability alone [S17].
- **Weighing sources:** most 2026 frontier results here are unreviewed preprints; the peer-reviewed
  anchors are [S5] (NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight), [S10] (ICML 2025), [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Activation patching = the gold-standard causal metric; attribution patching = its first-order,
  gradient-based approximation, adopted for cost [S19].
- A "circuit" is a subgraph claimed to explain a behavior on a sub-distribution; the contrasting
  framing asks instead whether a single weight can be understood globally [S2].
- Attribution graphs are computed on a replacement model that "incompletely and imperfectly
  captures the original", so they yield hypotheses, not conclusions [S11].
- Interchange-intervention accuracy is a fit statistic, meaningful only relative to a declared map
  class [S5].
- Monitorability ≠ faithfulness: a trace can be faithful and still omit factors a monitor needs [S12].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **The crowded list is still not exhaustive.** Every lane flagged here has now been
  saturation-checked and ALL came back occupied (all are listed above). No flagged lane remains open.
  **Treat any lane this map does not mention as unchecked, not open, and search before committing —
  the measured base rate for unchecked lanes in this forge is 11/11 occupied.**
- ⚠️ **The actionability negative result [S3] is one clinical domain, one model family.** It is the
  strongest published statement of the knowledge-action gap, but generalization beyond triage
  vignettes is unverified. Confirm/refute: a replication in a non-clinical task with the same
  four-method comparison.
- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed field-wide SURVEY was fetched** (a 2026 ACM Computing Surveys entry exists
  but was access-gated), and nothing independently confirms other labs made the same call as [S6].
  Individual claims are well-anchored — seven sources here are peer-reviewed — but a field-wide
  "the field holds X" statement still lacks a survey to rest on.

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase model discovery and calling)
- Scripts (Search, Get Params, Call)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: Model Discovery and Calling

### Phase 1: Search for Models
Find models with pricing, context length, and descriptions
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2 (optional): Get Model Parameters
Check what parameters a specific model supports
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

### Phase 3: Call Model
Call a model using the API name from search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" --input "What is 2+2?"
```

  --params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'
```

---

## Tips

- Use `aii_or_search_llms.py` first to find models, then copy `API` field for `--model`
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to check what params a model supports before using `--params`
- For web search, increase `--max-tokens` to handle larger responses (15000+)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: free-first web search (general or scholarly, Serper fallback), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

### [16] SKILL-INPUT — aii-parallel-computing · 2026-08-19 17:02:07 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-parallel-computing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "CRITICAL PERFORMANCE SKILL. Maximize hardware utilization for compute-intensive tasks. Covers GPU acceleration, CPU parallelism, and async I/O. The difference between hours of failure and minutes of success. Use whenever writing ANY script that processes data, makes API calls, or does computation."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

The agent loaded the **aii-python** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-python
description: Python coding standards for experiment and evaluation scripts. Covers environment setup, logging, error handling, and code structure.
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

````
---
name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: Gradual scaling pattern for long-running autonomous tasks. Use when running experiments, evaluations, or any code that processes data at increasing scale with runtime checks.
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

````
---
name: aii-use-hardware
description: Detect hardware and use it responsibly. Covers CPU/RAM/GPU detection, memory-safe data processing, and resource-aware computation.
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:

export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

Attempt 1 failed validation.

Schema validation found 3 problems — fix ALL of them at once:
  - at `<root>`: 'implementation_pseudocode' is a required property
  - at `<root>`: 'fallback_plan' is a required property
  - at `<root>`: 'testing_plan' is a required property
Every required field must be present and every field type must match the schema.

Produce `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` again so it contains corrected JSON that matches the schema. Do not invent new fields.
